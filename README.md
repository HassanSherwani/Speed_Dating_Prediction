# Speed_Dating_Prediction

This is the weekly coding challenge posted on Siraj Raval's youtube channel. The dataset can be found on kaggle.

It was compiled by professors Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar from Columbia Business School, originally used for their paper “Gender Differences in Mate Selection: Evidence From a Speed Dating Experiment.” Data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four minute "first date" with every other participant of the opposite sex.

At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests

# Dimensionality reduction

is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration, by obtaining a set of principal variables. It can be divided into feature selection and feature extraction.

# PCA(principal components Analysis)

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables (entities each of which takes on various numerical values) into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.

There is use of concept. sklearn provides easier way to program. This excercise is to understand math and basic concept behind PCA.
